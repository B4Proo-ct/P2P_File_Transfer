  A P2P file transfer tool using Django Channels.<br>
  Written in Python/Django
</p>

## Overview

`P2P File Transfer` is a Django-based tool for **securely transferring files between devices**, similar to [ShareDrop](https://github.com/szimek/sharedrop). It allows users to send and receive files directly over the network with **built-in encryption** for enhanced privacy.

## How It Works

Your data is protected using **AES 256-bit encryption**, making the file transfer process secure and reliable.

### Sender Process

1. The file is first `byte-encoded` (client-side).
2. The encoded file is then `encrypted` using AES 256-bit encryption (server-side).
3. The encrypted file is `transferred` to the recipient (still encrypted).

### Receiver Process

1. The received file is `decrypted` using the same encryption key (server-side).
2. The decrypted data is `byte-decoded` (client-side).
3. The original file is `reconstructed` and made available for download.

This way only the intended recipient can access the file throughout the transfer.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to **provide an open-source application that anyone can use and learn from**.

## Setup for Local Development

### Install uv

```bash
cd path/to/root/directory
pip install uv
```

### Create Enviroment Variable file

```bash
touch .env
nano .env
```

Add the following (adjust as needed):

```ini
SECRET_KEY="example_secret_key"  # https://stackoverflow.com/a/57678930
ENCRYPTION_KEY="example_encryption_key"  # https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/#cryptography.fernet.Fernet
DEBUG=True  # For development
```

Save changes and close the file.

### Migrate Database (Optional)

```bash
uv run manage.py migrate
```

### Run Django Server

```bash
uv run manage.py runserver
```

Access web application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` or `http://localhost:8000/`. Open two browser windows to transfer files between users.

## Run Tests

```bash
uv run manage.py test
```
